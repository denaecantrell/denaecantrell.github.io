  <h2>Electromagnetic Systems and Control</h2>
  <p><em>Masters research project</em></p>

  <p>
    This project explores how magnetic fields can be used to control the motion
    of magnetized particles for magnetic drug delivery, where therapeutic
    particles are directed toward sites of disease.
  </p>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Magnetic fields cannot create stable equilibrium points in free space to
    trap magnetized particles. Magnetized spherical particles, which are commonly 
    used as therapeutic carriers, align with the applied field and move toward 
    its source, making precise positioning infeasible. In contrast, anisotropic 
    magnetic nanorods exhibit transient rotational dynamics that can be used to push 
    the particles away from the source.
  </p>

  <h3>Model and Control Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    I developed a physics-based dynamic model describing the rotational and 
    translational motion of magnetic nanorods under external magnetic fields.
    The model captures transient rotational dynamics caused by particle
    anisotropy and demonstrates how magnetic targeting can be achieved in the 
    absence of a stable equilibrium point.
  </p>
  <p>
    A uniform magnetic field aligned the nanorods along a fixed direction, after
    which a second pulse applied in the opposite direction pushed the particles
    away from the field source. Repeating this actuation periodically in four
    directions produced net average motion toward a target point.
  </p>
  <p>
    This control strategy builds on prior experimental work, with the pulse sequence
    modified to use sinusoidal fields to better reflect realistic experimental
    constraints.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Simulation</h3>
  <p>
    The system dynamics were simulated in MATLAB to study transient behavior
    and stability over a single actuation period. The simulations were also
    used to study the average behavior of the particle, confirming that the 
    control sequence produces an average net displacement toward the target.
    These results guided parameter selection and experimental testing.
  </p>

  <h3>Experimental Validation</h3>
  <p>
    The model and control approach were validated through laboratory experiments
    using LabVIEW and the Arduino IDE. The observed transient dynamics matched those
    predicted by the model.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This work is currently under review for the American Control Conference (ACC).

  <h2>Quadruped Autonomy and Navigation (Unitree Go2)</h2>
  <p><em>Team robotics project</em></p>

  <p>
    This project focused on deploying an autonomous navigation and exploration
    stack on the Unitree Go2 quadruped for search-and-rescue-style tasks in
    indoor environments. The system integrated perception, mapping, and
    planning to enable reliable autonomous operation on hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    My contributions included developing frontier-based exploration logic,
    setting up Ethernet networking for reliable on-robot connectivity, and
    launching and managing onboard processes during experimental trials.
  </p>

  <p>
    A detailed project description, including system architecture, videos,
    and experimental results, is available on the team project website:

  <h2>Real-Time Power System Simulation (OPAL-RT)</h2>
  <p><em>Laboratory training and infrastructure support</em></p>

  <p>
    I worked with an OPAL-RT real-time simulator set up in the lab, running
    power system models in real time and supporting their use in experiments by
    other researchers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To improve usability within the lab, I wrote documentation for future 
    researchers, covering model deployment for working with the simulator.

  <h2>Distributed Lighting Control (Personal Project)</h2>
  <p><em>Independent hardware/software project</em></p>
  
  <p>
    As a personal project, I implemented a standalone lighting control system using a
    Raspberry Pi 4 running Falcon Player (FPP), integrating WOW Lights singing
    trees and Light-O-Rama-controlled trees and arches. The system was isolated
    onto dedicated hardware and configured through FPP’s access-point GUI for
    reliable, standalone operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project required debugging timing, networking, and configuration issues
    to ensure consistent operation during extended real-world use.
