<h2>Electromagnetic Systems and Control</h2>
<p><em>Masters research project</em></p>

<p>
  This project explores how magnetic fields can be used to control the motion
  of magnetized particles for magnetic drug delivery, where therapeutic
  particles are directed toward sites of disease.
</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  Magnetic fields cannot create stable equilibrium points in free space to
  trap magnetized particles. Magnetized spherical particles, which are commonly 
  used as therapeutic carriers, align with the applied field and move toward 
  its source, making precise positioning infeasible. In contrast, anisotropic 
  magnetic nanorods exhibit transient rotational dynamics that can be used to push 
  the particles away from the source.
</p>

<h3>Model and Control Strategy</h3>
<p>
  I developed a physics-based dynamic model describing the rotational and 
  translational motion of magnetic nanorods under external magnetic fields.
  The model captures transient rotational dynamics caused by particle
  anisotropy and demonstrates how magnetic targeting can be achieved in the 
  absence of a stable equilibrium point.
</p>
<p>
  A uniform magnetic field aligned the nanorods along a fixed direction, after
  which a second pulse applied in the opposite direction pushed the particles
  away from the field source. Repeating this actuation periodically in four
  directions produced net average motion toward a target point.
</p>
<p>
  This control strategy builds on prior experimental work, with the pulse sequence
  modified to use sinusoidal fields to better reflect realistic experimental
  constraints.
</p>
  
<h3>Simulation</h3>
<p>
  The system dynamics were simulated in MATLAB to study transient behavior
  and stability over a single actuation period. The simulations were also
  used to study the average behavior of the particle, confirming that the 
  control sequence produces an average net displacement toward the target.
  These results guided parameter selection and experimental testing.
</p>

<h3>Experimental Validation</h3>
<p>
  The model and control approach were validated through laboratory experiments
  using LabVIEW and the Arduino IDE. The observed transient dynamics matched those
  predicted by the model.
